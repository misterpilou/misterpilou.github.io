#+title: A blog about workflow, programming and making my way into a gnu world

* Overview

This is an example of a website written with _org-mode_. 
Here is a link to my [[./projects.org][others projects]] i will be doing in parallel

* This site would be a small blog about me and my pursuit of gnurvana


Recently i decide to take the path of using gnu tools to change my workflow, more precisely a lot of gnu tools.
Those include *guix*, *emacs* and *org-mode*. As a way of maintaining and continuing this goal, i'm trying to
generate a blog directly via org to takes notes and memos about my way into the gnu style of doing computing.
To be honest, i always wanting to try those tools. It looks so comfy, simple and i know a lots of great people maintain
this workflow for years and made it wonderful. So i will try to dig into it and make my way.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "This is a test to see if code block shows off";
    return 0;
}
#+END_SRC
